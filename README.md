# Connect4-Game

This is a Connect 4 game that you can play either singleplayer or multiplayer. There are 3 different difficulties on singleplayer.
The difficulty depends on how many moves the computer looks ahead. Easy analyses only your current move, medium also analyses the opponents move and the hard difficulty also analyses the move after. You can also save games midway through and undo previous moves. The singleplayer isn't perfect as the scoring is dependant on total adjacent counters so it isn't completely optimal. The AI system is implemented using a minmax tree giving a score for each possible move and then choosing the best move based on the best score.

THe downloadable .exe file is found in the download file and the code for the program is found within the MAJOR PROJECT file.
