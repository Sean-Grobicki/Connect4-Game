# Connect4-Game

This is a Connect 4 game that you can play either singleplayer or multiplayer. There are 3 different difficulties on singleplayer.
The difficulty depends on how many moves the computer it looks ahead with easy only looking at the next move, medium also looks at the opponents move and the hard difficulty also looks at the move the computer could make in 2 turns. You can also save games midway through and undo previous moves. The singleplayer isn't perfect as the scoring is dependant on total adjacent counters so isn't optimised. 

Enjoy the game.
